Hi, my name is Kasper Salsman and I'm a Student at NSCCâ€™s Institute of Technology for IT Programming. Ive always enjoyed computers since I was young, whether it was playing games or trying to figure out how they work. So, I always knew I would want to find a career in computers.
Here you will find my projects I work on throughout the course. This acts as a collection of projects I think showcase my skills the best. Thank you very much.
